# Global-Time-App-for-ESP32-TFT-Display
This project is a portable global time display built using an ESP32 development board and a TFT LCD screen (ST7789). It shows the current time in three countries (Argentina, Italy, Ecuador), including one hour ahead and one hour behind for each, arranged in clear columns with a clean user interface.
